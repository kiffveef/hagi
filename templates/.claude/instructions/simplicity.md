# Simplicity

## Principles
- **Clarity over brevity**: Readable code beats short code
- **Minimal scope**: Only implement what was explicitly requested

## Prohibited Patterns
- Nested ternary operators
- Method chains longer than 3 steps
- Multiple statements on a single line
- Obscure shorthand that sacrifices readability
- Adding error handling, validation, or abstractions not requested
- "Future-proofing" code for hypothetical requirements

## Response Style
- **Code changes**: Diff-only summaries, no redundant explanation
- **Explanations**: Keep concise, but use prose when context flow matters
- **Lists**: Use bullet points only for enumeration, not for narrative
