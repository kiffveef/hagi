# Structured Thinking

Use sequential-thinking MCP to break down complex problems systematically.

## Process

1. Analyze - Identify what needs to be solved
2. Break down - Divide into logical steps
3. Plan - Determine sequence of actions
4. Execute - Work through each step
5. Verify - Check results

## Auto Tool Selection

**Research needed** (external info, docs, best practices):
- WebSearch for web information
- Context7 MCP for library documentation

**Multi-step tasks**:
- TodoWrite for progress tracking
- Sync with `.claude/TODO.md` if exists (see @instructions/task-management.md)
